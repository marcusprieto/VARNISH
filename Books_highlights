Varnish is more than a reverse HTTP proxy. Depending on the installation, Varnish can be used as:

• web application firewall,
• DDoS attacks defender,
• load balancer,
• integration point,
• single sign-on gateway,
• authentication and authorization policy mechanism,
• quick fix for unstable backends, and
• HTTP router.

If you want to migrate your VCL code from Varnish 3 to Varnish 4, you may be interested in looking
at the varnish3to4 script. See the VCL Migrator from Varnish 3 to Varnish 4 section for more
